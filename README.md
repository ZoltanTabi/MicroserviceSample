# Microservice Sample Application

This repository contains a sample microservice application inspired by the tutorial video: [Building Microservices with .NET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI).

## Overview

The project demonstrates the implementation of a microservice architecture using modern development practices. It includes features such as service communication, data persistence, and scalability.

## Features

- **Independent Services**: Each service is designed to be self-contained and independently deployable.
- **RESTful APIs**: Services communicate using HTTP-based APIs.
- **Database Integration**: Each service manages its own database.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale horizontally.
